This is a program that keeps the top "X" songs in ur playlist and removes the rest and then filters them through your most listened to songs and if the "X" songs are not in those most listened to songs then removes them too.
It also backsup the names of the songs removed in a json file so you can look through them :)

To make the program run u must change the "CLIENT_ID",the "CLIENT_SECRET",and the "PLAYLIST_ID" in the code
